    <h2>Description</h2>
      <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Chicken Breasts: Use a sharp knife of kitchen shears to cut three boneless, skinless chicken breasts into cubes. You don't have to be too precise, but aim for 1-inch cubes to ensure even cooking</li>
        <li>White Rice: You can't have a chicken and rice casserole without rice! This convenient recipe calls for instant white rice, which is cheap and readily available at any grocery store.</li>
        <li>Water: Liquid (in this case water) is essential to any rice-based recipe, as the rice needs something to absorb during the cooking process.</li>
        <li>Cream of Chicken Soup, Cream of Selery Soup, and Cream of Mushroom Soup: Like many old-fashion recipes, this chicken and rice casserole relies on canned soups for rich flavor and creamy texture.</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper: Simple seasonings make Mamaw's Chicken and Rice Casserole a crowed-pleaser for all ages. Of course, you can spice things up a but to suit your flavor preferences.</li>
        <li>Butter: Because doesn't butter make everything better? "You can use less butter on top of course," sayscipe creator katiefbenham. "My Momma and Mamaw always put the full stick on top (gotta love Southern ladies and their butter!)"</li>
      </ul>
